Here is my take on this season's #DataPlusMovies challenge powered by Tableau and IMDB Movie.

For this challenge, I have chosen to showcase the works of the legendary Indian movie director, S.S. Rajamouli. His movies like Bahubali, RRR, and Magadheera have undoubtedly become classics, making him an influential figure in Indian cinema.
